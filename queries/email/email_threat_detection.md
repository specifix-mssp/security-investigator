## Overview

This collection of KQL queries covers email-based threat detection across the Microsoft Defender for Office 365 (MDO) tables available in Sentinel Data Lake. These tables power investigations for phishing campaigns, AiTM attacks, BEC fraud, malware delivery, and email exfiltration.

**Tables Reference:**

| Table | Purpose | Key Join Column |
|-------|---------|-----------------|
| `EmailEvents` | Core email metadata — sender, recipient, direction, threats, delivery action | `NetworkMessageId` |
| `EmailPostDeliveryEvents` | Post-delivery actions — ZAP (zero-hour auto purge), manual remediation | `NetworkMessageId` |
| `EmailUrlInfo` | URLs embedded in emails | `NetworkMessageId` |
| `EmailAttachmentInfo` | File attachments in emails | `NetworkMessageId` |
| `UrlClickEvents` | Safe Links click tracking — who clicked, was it blocked or allowed | `NetworkMessageId`, `Url` |

> **⚠️ Data Lake vs Advanced Hunting:** These tables exist in the Sentinel Data Lake when the Defender XDR connector is enabled. Use `TimeGenerated` (not `Timestamp`) as the datetime column in Data Lake queries. If a table is missing, retry with `RunAdvancedHuntingQuery` using `Timestamp`.

## 1. Mail Flow Overview

### 1.1 Inbound Email Summary with Threat Breakdown

High-level view of inbound email volume and threat categorization.

<!-- cd-metadata
cd_ready: false
adaptation_notes: "Aggregation/dashboard query — summarizes inbound mail volume with threat category breakdown. No row-level detection."
-->
```kql
EmailEvents
| where TimeGenerated > ago(30d)
| where EmailDirection == "Inbound"
| summarize
    TotalInbound = count(),
    Clean = countif(isempty(ThreatTypes)),
    Phish = countif(ThreatTypes has "Phish"),
    Malware = countif(ThreatTypes has "Malware"),
    Spam = countif(ThreatTypes has "Spam"),
    HighConfPhish = countif(ConfidenceLevel has "High" and ThreatTypes has "Phish"),
    Blocked = countif(DeliveryAction == "Blocked"),
    Delivered = countif(DeliveryAction == "Delivered"),
    Junked = countif(DeliveryAction == "Junked"),
    DistinctSenders = dcount(SenderFromAddress),
    DistinctRecipients = dcount(RecipientEmailAddress)
| project TotalInbound, Clean, Phish, Malware, Spam, HighConfPhish,
    Blocked, Delivered, Junked, DistinctSenders, DistinctRecipients
```

### 1.2 Email Volume Trend by Day and Direction

Daily trend useful for spotting anomalous spikes (e.g., phishing campaigns).

<!-- cd-metadata
cd_ready: false
adaptation_notes: "Time-series aggregation query — bins email volume by day and direction. Baseline trend tool, not a detection."
-->
```kql
EmailEvents
| where TimeGenerated > ago(30d)
| summarize Count = count() by EmailDirection, Day = bin(TimeGenerated, 1d)
| order by Day asc, EmailDirection
```

### 1.3 Top Sender Domains by Volume

Identify high-volume sending domains — useful for spotting impersonation or bulk senders.

<!-- cd-metadata
cd_ready: false
adaptation_notes: "Aggregation query — top sender domains by volume with take 20. Baseline/hunting tool."
-->
```kql
EmailEvents
| where TimeGenerated > ago(30d)
| where EmailDirection == "Inbound"
| summarize
    EmailCount = count(),
    PhishCount = countif(ThreatTypes has "Phish"),
    SpamCount = countif(ThreatTypes has "Spam"),
    DistinctSenders = dcount(SenderFromAddress)
    by SenderFromDomain
| order by EmailCount desc
| take 20
```

## 2. Phishing Detection

### 2.1 Phishing Emails — Detailed View

List all emails detected as phishing with delivery details.

<!-- cd-metadata
cd_ready: false
adaptation_notes: "Row-level phishing listing, but redundant with existing MDO phishing detections. Better used as investigation query than CD."
-->
```kql
EmailEvents
| where TimeGenerated > ago(30d)
| where ThreatTypes has "Phish"
| project TimeGenerated, Subject, SenderFromAddress, SenderFromDomain,
    RecipientEmailAddress, DeliveryAction, DeliveryLocation,
    LatestDeliveryAction, LatestDeliveryLocation,
    ThreatTypes, ThreatNames, DetectionMethods,
    NetworkMessageId, InternetMessageId
| order by TimeGenerated desc
```

### 2.2 Top Phishing Sender Domains

Quick view of which domains are sending the most phishing emails.

<!-- cd-metadata
cd_ready: false
adaptation_notes: "Aggregation query — top phishing sender domains. Hunting/triage tool."
-->
```kql
EmailEvents
| where TimeGenerated > ago(30d)
| where ThreatTypes has "Phish"
| summarize Count = count() by SenderFromDomain
| top 10 by Count
```

### 2.3 Most Targeted Recipients for Phishing

Identify users receiving the most phishing attempts — high-value targets or compromised distribution lists.

<!-- cd-metadata
cd_ready: false
adaptation_notes: "Aggregation query — summarizes phishing count per recipient. Hunting/triage tool."
-->
```kql
EmailEvents
| where TimeGenerated > ago(30d)
| where ThreatTypes has "Phish" and EmailDirection == "Inbound"
| summarize PhishCount = count(), DistinctSenders = dcount(SenderFromAddress) by RecipientEmailAddress
| order by PhishCount desc
| take 15
```

### 2.4 Phishing Emails That Were Delivered (Not Blocked)

Critical: phishing emails that made it to user mailboxes — potential compromise indicators.

<!-- cd-metadata
cd_ready: true
schedule: "1H"
category: "InitialAccess"
title: "Phishing Email Delivered to Mailbox — {{RecipientEmailAddress}}"
impactedAssets:
  - type: "mailbox"
    identifier: "recipientEmailAddress"
recommendedActions: "Check if user clicked any URLs or opened attachments. Review Safe Links click activity via UrlClickEvents. Investigate user sign-ins for signs of compromise."
responseActions: "Purge email from mailbox via manual remediation. Revoke user sessions if compromise suspected. Block sender domain."
-->
```kql
EmailEvents
| where TimeGenerated > ago(30d)
| where ThreatTypes has "Phish"

| project TimeGenerated, Subject, SenderFromAddress, RecipientEmailAddress,
    DeliveryAction, LatestDeliveryAction, DeliveryLocation, LatestDeliveryLocation,
    ThreatNames, DetectionMethods, NetworkMessageId
| order by TimeGenerated desc
```

### 2.5 First-Contact Phishing Attempts

Emails from senders who have never emailed the recipient before. A strong AiTM/BEC indicator.

<!-- cd-metadata
cd_ready: true
schedule: "1H"
category: "InitialAccess"
title: "First-Contact Phishing Attempt — {{RecipientEmailAddress}}"
impactedAssets:
  - type: "mailbox"
    identifier: "recipientEmailAddress"
recommendedActions: "Verify sender legitimacy. Check if user interacted with URLs or attachments. Review UrlClickEvents for Safe Links activity."
responseActions: "Purge email from mailbox. Block sender domain if confirmed malicious. Alert user not to interact with message."
adaptation_notes: "The UrlCount > 3 branch catches non-phishing emails with many URLs — consider removing for tighter CD scope."
-->
```kql
EmailEvents
| where TimeGenerated > ago(30d)
| where EmailDirection == "Inbound"
| where IsFirstContact == true
| where ThreatTypes has "Phish" or UrlCount > 3
| project TimeGenerated, Subject, SenderFromAddress, SenderFromDomain,
    RecipientEmailAddress, IsFirstContact, UrlCount, AttachmentCount,
    ThreatTypes, DeliveryAction, NetworkMessageId
| order by TimeGenerated desc
```

## 3. AiTM / Adversary-in-the-Middle Hunting

### 3.1 AiTM Proxy Sign-In Detection (OfficeHome App)

AiTM kits like Evilginx2 authenticate through the OfficeHome app. Cross-country or multi-IP sessions within the same `OriginalRequestId` are indicators.

> **Note:** This query uses `SigninLogs`, not `EmailEvents`, but is included because it directly follows from email-based AiTM phishing.

<!-- cd-metadata
cd_ready: true
schedule: "3H"
category: "CredentialAccess"
title: "AiTM Multi-Country OfficeHome Session — {{UserPrincipalName}}"
impactedAssets:
  - type: "user"
    identifier: "accountUpn"
recommendedActions: "Verify whether user has legitimate multi-country VPN usage. Cross-reference with AADUserRiskEvents for anomalousToken detections. Check inbox rules via OfficeActivity."
responseActions: "Revoke user refresh tokens. Force MFA re-registration. Investigate concurrent sessions and inbox rule changes."
adaptation_notes: "Uses SigninLogs (available in AH via connected workspace). Change TimeGenerated to Timestamp for AH. The let variable is a constant AppId, not a parameter."
-->
```kql
// Detect OfficeHome sessions with multi-country sign-ins (AiTM token replay indicator)
let OfficeHomeAppId = "4765445b-32c6-49b0-83e6-1d93765276ca";
SigninLogs
| where TimeGenerated > ago(30d)
| where AppId == OfficeHomeAppId
| extend Country = tostring(parse_json(LocationDetails).countryOrRegion)
| extend City = tostring(parse_json(LocationDetails).city)
| summarize
    Countries = make_set(Country),
    Cities = make_set(City),
    IPs = make_set(IPAddress),
    SignIns = count()
    by UserPrincipalName, OriginalRequestId
| where array_length(Countries) > 1
| project UserPrincipalName, OriginalRequestId, Countries, Cities, IPs, SignIns
| order by SignIns desc
```

### 3.2 AiTM Full Chain: Phishing Email → Anomalous Token → Inbox Rule

Correlate the full AiTM attack chain: phishing email received → anomalous token detected → inbox rule created.

<!-- cd-metadata
cd_ready: false
adaptation_notes: "Multi-stage investigation chain — uses let block with cross-table join (EmailEvents → AADUserRiskEvents). AADUserRiskEvents may not be available in AH. Better used as forensic follow-up after AiTM alert."
-->
```kql
// Step 1: Find phishing emails delivered to users
let PhishedUsers = EmailEvents
| where TimeGenerated > ago(30d)
| where ThreatTypes has "Phish" and EmailDirection == "Inbound"
| where DeliveryAction != "Blocked"
| distinct RecipientEmailAddress;
// Step 2: Check for anomalous token risk events for those users
AADUserRiskEvents
| where TimeGenerated > ago(30d)
| where RiskEventType == "anomalousToken"
| where UserPrincipalName in~ (PhishedUsers)
| project TimeGenerated, UserPrincipalName, RiskEventType, RiskLevel,
    IpAddress, Location, RiskState
| order by TimeGenerated desc
```

### 3.3 Inbox Rules Created After Phishing Email Delivery

Detect inbox rules created shortly after a phishing email was received — key AiTM/BEC indicator.

<!-- cd-metadata
cd_ready: false
adaptation_notes: "Cross-table correlation (EmailEvents → OfficeActivity). OfficeActivity is Sentinel-only and may not be available in Advanced Hunting. Forensic follow-up query."
-->
```kql
let PhishRecipients = EmailEvents
| where TimeGenerated > ago(30d)
| where ThreatTypes has "Phish" and EmailDirection == "Inbound"
| where DeliveryAction != "Blocked"
| project RecipientEmailAddress, PhishTime = TimeGenerated;
OfficeActivity
| where TimeGenerated > ago(30d)
| where OfficeWorkload == "Exchange"
| where Operation in~ ("New-InboxRule", "Set-InboxRule", "UpdateInboxRules")
| join kind=inner PhishRecipients on $left.UserId == $right.RecipientEmailAddress
| where TimeGenerated between (PhishTime .. (PhishTime + 24h))
| project TimeGenerated, UserId, Operation, Parameters, PhishTime,
    ClientIP, SessionId
| order by TimeGenerated desc
```

## 4. Email Authentication Analysis

### 4.1 Email Authentication Failures (DMARC/DKIM/SPF)

Identify emails failing authentication checks — spoofing indicators.

<!-- cd-metadata
cd_ready: false
adaptation_notes: "Extremely noisy — DMARC/DKIM/SPF failures are common for legitimate email. Would generate thousands of CD alerts per day. Use as hunting/investigation baseline, not detection."
-->
```kql
EmailEvents
| where TimeGenerated > ago(30d)
| where EmailDirection == "Inbound"
| extend AuthDetails = parse_json(AuthenticationDetails)
| extend
    DMARC = tostring(AuthDetails.DMARC),
    DKIM = tostring(AuthDetails.DKIM),
    SPF = tostring(AuthDetails.SPF),
    CompAuth = tostring(AuthDetails.CompAuth)
| where DMARC == "fail" or DKIM == "fail" or SPF == "fail" or CompAuth == "fail"
| project TimeGenerated, SenderFromAddress, SenderFromDomain,
    SenderMailFromDomain, RecipientEmailAddress, Subject,
    DMARC, DKIM, SPF, CompAuth, DeliveryAction
| order by TimeGenerated desc
```

### 4.2 Authentication Failure Summary by Domain

Aggregate authentication failures by sender domain to identify systematic spoofing.

<!-- cd-metadata
cd_ready: false
adaptation_notes: "Aggregation query — summarizes auth failure counts by domain. Hunting/triage tool."
-->
```kql
EmailEvents
| where TimeGenerated > ago(30d)
| where EmailDirection == "Inbound"

| extend
    DMARC = tostring(AuthDetails.DMARC),
    DKIM = tostring(AuthDetails.DKIM),
    SPF = tostring(AuthDetails.SPF),
    CompAuth = tostring(AuthDetails.CompAuth)
| summarize
    TotalEmails = count(),
    DMARCFail = countif(DMARC == "fail"),
    DKIMFail = countif(DKIM == "fail"),
    SPFFail = countif(SPF == "fail"),
    CompAuthFail = countif(CompAuth == "fail")
    by SenderFromDomain
| where DMARCFail > 0 or DKIMFail > 0 or SPFFail > 0 or CompAuthFail > 0
| order by TotalEmails desc
```

### 4.3 Envelope-From vs Header-From Mismatch (Display Name Spoofing)

Detects when the MAIL FROM domain doesn't match the FROM header domain — common in spoofing.

<!-- cd-metadata
cd_ready: false
adaptation_notes: "Aggregation query — summarizes envelope/header mismatch count by domain pair. Hunting/triage tool for identifying spoofing patterns."
-->
```kql
EmailEvents
| where TimeGenerated > ago(30d)
| where EmailDirection == "Inbound"
| where SenderFromDomain != SenderMailFromDomain
| where isnotempty(SenderMailFromDomain)
| summarize
    Count = count(),
    Subjects = make_set(Subject, 3)
    by SenderFromDomain, SenderMailFromDomain, SenderFromAddress
| order by Count desc
| take 20
```

## 5. Detection Methods & Policy Analysis

### 5.1 Detection Methods Breakdown

Understand what MDO detection methods are triggering on inbound mail.

<!-- cd-metadata
cd_ready: false
adaptation_notes: "Aggregation query — summarizes detection method frequency. Operational dashboard/reporting query."
-->
```kql
EmailEvents
| where TimeGenerated > ago(30d)
| where isnotempty(DetectionMethods) and DetectionMethods != "{}"
| extend DetMethods = parse_json(DetectionMethods)
| extend FirstDetection = tostring(bag_keys(DetMethods)[0])
| extend FirstSubcategory = iif(
    FirstDetection != "" and array_length(DetMethods[FirstDetection]) > 0,
    strcat(FirstDetection, ": ", tostring(DetMethods[FirstDetection][0])),
    FirstDetection)
| summarize Count = count() by FirstSubcategory
| order by Count desc
```

### 5.2 Overridden Threats (Allow Policies Bypassing Detection)

Emails detected as threats but allowed by policy — review for false negative risk.

<!-- cd-metadata
cd_ready: false
adaptation_notes: "Aggregation query — summarizes override/allow counts by policy type. Operational dashboard for policy tuning."
-->
```kql
EmailEvents
| where TimeGenerated > ago(30d)
| where OrgLevelAction == "Allow" and isnotempty(ThreatTypes)
| summarize Count = count() by ThreatTypes, OrgLevelPolicy, DetectionMethods
| order by Count desc
```

### 5.3 Third-Party Detection Integration

Emails detected by non-Microsoft security vendors integrated via ICES.

<!-- cd-metadata
cd_ready: false
adaptation_notes: "Monitoring/investigation query — lists all third-party detections without threat filtering. Volume varies widely by environment. Better as hunting tool."
-->
```kql
EmailEvents
| where TimeGenerated > ago(30d)
| where DetectionMethods contains "Thirdparty"
| project TimeGenerated, NetworkMessageId, RecipientEmailAddress,
    SenderFromAddress, ThreatTypes, DetectionMethods,
    LatestDeliveryLocation
| order by TimeGenerated desc
```

## 6. Post-Delivery Actions (ZAP & Remediation)

### 6.1 ZAP Actions Summary

Overview of Zero-hour Auto Purge activity — catches threats discovered after delivery.

<!-- cd-metadata
cd_ready: false
adaptation_notes: "Aggregation query — summarizes ZAP action counts by type. Operational dashboard for ZAP effectiveness monitoring."
-->
```kql
EmailPostDeliveryEvents
| where TimeGenerated > ago(30d)

    SuccessCount = countif(ActionResult == "Success"),
    ErrorCount = countif(ActionResult == "Error")
| project TotalActions, PhishZAP, MalwareZAP, SpamZAP, SuccessCount, ErrorCount
```

### 6.2 Failed ZAP Actions (Threats Still in Mailbox)

Critical: ZAP attempted remediation but failed — threats may still be in user mailboxes.

<!-- cd-metadata
cd_ready: true
schedule: "1H"
category: "DefenseEvasion"
title: "ZAP Remediation Failed — Threat Still in Mailbox {{RecipientEmailAddress}}"
impactedAssets:
  - type: "mailbox"
    identifier: "recipientEmailAddress"
recommendedActions: "Manually remediate the email from affected mailboxes. Verify ZAP failure reason (e.g., message in shared mailbox, retention policy, user moved to subfolder). Check if user interacted with the threat."
responseActions: "Purge threat from mailbox via manual remediation. Review user activity for signs of compromise. Investigate UrlClickEvents if URLs were present."
-->
```kql
EmailPostDeliveryEvents
| where TimeGenerated > ago(30d)
| where ActionType has "ZAP" and ActionResult == "Error"
| join kind=inner (
    EmailEvents

) on NetworkMessageId, RecipientEmailAddress
| project TimeGenerated, ActionType, ActionResult, RecipientEmailAddress,
    SenderFromAddress, Subject, ThreatTypes, LatestDeliveryLocation,
    NetworkMessageId
| order by TimeGenerated desc
```

### 6.3 User Activity After Failed ZAP (Compromise Check)

Check if users who received un-remediated emails had subsequent suspicious sign-in activity.

<!-- cd-metadata
cd_ready: false
adaptation_notes: "Cross-table investigation chain (EmailPostDeliveryEvents → EmailEvents → SigninLogs). Multi-step correlation with risk-based filtering. Better as forensic follow-up after ZAP failure alert."
-->
```kql

    UrlCount = dcount(Url),
    EmailCount = dcount(NetworkMessageId)
    by UrlDomain
| where UrlCount > 2
| order by UrlCount desc
| take 20
```

### 7.2 Suspicious URL Patterns (Long URLs, Encoded Params)

Hunt for URLs with characteristics common in phishing kits — long URLs, base64-like parameters.

<!-- cd-metadata
cd_ready: false
adaptation_notes: "Hunting query with heuristic thresholds (strlen > 200, contains patterns). Uses take 50 for manual review. Not precise enough for automated CD alerting."
-->
```kql
EmailUrlInfo
| where TimeGenerated > ago(30d)
| where strlen(Url) > 200
| join kind=inner (
    EmailEvents
    | where TimeGenerated > ago(30d)

) on NetworkMessageId
| project TimeGenerated, SenderFromAddress, RecipientEmailAddress,
    Subject, Url, UrlDomain, ThreatTypes, DeliveryAction
| order by TimeGenerated desc
| take 50
```

### 7.3 Safe Links Clicks — All Activity

Full Safe Links click tracking — who clicked what URL, and was it allowed or blocked.

<!-- cd-metadata
cd_ready: false
adaptation_notes: "Full activity listing — includes both blocked and allowed clicks without threat filtering. Too noisy for CD; use Q7.4 (allowed clicks on malicious URLs) instead."

| project TimeGenerated, AccountUpn, Url, UrlChain,
    ActionType, IsClickedThrough, ThreatTypes,
    IPAddress, NetworkMessageId, Workload
| order by TimeGenerated desc
```

### 7.4 Clicks Allowed on Malicious URLs (User Exposed to Threat)

URLs that Safe Links identified as threats but the user was allowed through — high-risk exposure.

<!-- cd-metadata
cd_ready: true
schedule: "1H"
category: "InitialAccess"
title: "User Clicked Malicious URL — {{AccountUpn}}"
impactedAssets:
  - type: "user"
    identifier: "accountUpn"

## 9. Business Email Compromise (BEC)

### 9.1 Outbound Emails from Compromised Accounts

After account takeover, attackers send BEC payment fraud emails from the victim's mailbox.

<!-- cd-metadata
cd_ready: false
adaptation_notes: "Parameter-dependent — requires let SuspectedUsers list to be populated with known compromised accounts. Investigation follow-up query, not standalone detection."

## 11. Cross-Table Correlation Queries

### 11.1 Phishing Email → Device Logon Correlation

Find device logons within 30 minutes of receiving a phishing email — indicates user interacted with the phish.

<!-- cd-metadata
cd_ready: true

## 12. Targeted Investigation Queries

### 12.1 All Emails for a Specific User

Pull all email activity for a specific user under investigation.

<!-- cd-metadata
cd_ready: false
adaptation_notes: "Parameter-dependent — requires let TargetUser to be populated. Investigation/forensic query for specific user analysis."
-->
```kql
let TargetUser = "<UPN>";
EmailEvents
| where TimeGenerated > ago(30d)
| where RecipientEmailAddress =~ TargetUser or SenderFromAddress =~ TargetUser
| project TimeGenerated, EmailDirection, SenderFromAddress, RecipientEmailAddress,
    Subject, ThreatTypes, DeliveryAction, LatestDeliveryAction,
    UrlCount, AttachmentCount, IsFirstContact, NetworkMessageId
| order by TimeGenerated desc
```

### 12.2 Trace a Specific Email by NetworkMessageId

Deep-dive into a single email across all related tables.

<!-- cd-metadata
cd_ready: false
adaptation_notes: "Parameter-dependent — requires let MsgId (NetworkMessageId). Multi-query investigation block using semicolons to query EmailEvents, EmailUrlInfo, EmailAttachmentInfo, and EmailPostDeliveryEvents separately. Forensic drill-down, not detection."
-->
```kql
let MsgId = "<NetworkMessageId>";
// Core email metadata
EmailEvents
| where NetworkMessageId == MsgId
| project TimeGenerated, SenderFromAddress, RecipientEmailAddress, Subject,
    EmailDirection, ThreatTypes, DetectionMethods, DeliveryAction,
    LatestDeliveryAction, LatestDeliveryLocation, AuthenticationDetails;
// URLs in the email
EmailUrlInfo
| where NetworkMessageId == MsgId
| project Url, UrlDomain, UrlLocation;
// Attachments in the email
EmailAttachmentInfo
| where NetworkMessageId == MsgId
| project FileName, FileType, FileExtension, SHA256, ThreatTypes;
// Post-delivery actions
EmailPostDeliveryEvents
| where NetworkMessageId == MsgId
| project TimeGenerated, ActionType, ActionResult;
// Click events
UrlClickEvents
| where NetworkMessageId == MsgId
| project TimeGenerated, AccountUpn, Url, ActionType, IsClickedThrough, ThreatTypes
```

### 12.3 Emails from a Suspicious Sender

Investigate all emails from a specific sender address or domain.

<!-- cd-metadata
cd_ready: false
adaptation_notes: "Parameter-dependent — requires let SuspiciousSender to be populated. 90-day lookback exceeds CD maximum. Investigation/forensic query for sender-based analysis."
-->
```kql
let SuspiciousSender = "<sender@domain.com>";
EmailEvents
| where TimeGenerated > ago(90d)
| where SenderFromAddress =~ SuspiciousSender
    or SenderMailFromAddress =~ SuspiciousSender
| project TimeGenerated, SenderFromAddress, SenderMailFromAddress,
    RecipientEmailAddress, Subject, ThreatTypes, DeliveryAction,
    UrlCount, AttachmentCount, AuthenticationDetails, NetworkMessageId
| order by TimeGenerated desc
```

## Schema Quick Reference

### EmailEvents Key Columns

| Column | Type | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| `NetworkMessageId` | string | Primary key — joins to all other email tables |
| `InternetMessageId` | string | RFC 5322 message ID from sending system |
| `EmailDirection` | string | `Inbound`, `Outbound`, `Intra-org` |
| `ThreatTypes` | string | Pipe-delimited: `Phish`, `Malware`, `Spam` |
| `DetectionMethods` | string | JSON string — use `parse_json()` to extract |
| `AuthenticationDetails` | string | JSON string with DMARC/DKIM/SPF/CompAuth results |
| `DeliveryAction` | string | Initial action: `Delivered`, `Blocked`, `Junked`, `Replaced` |
| `LatestDeliveryAction` | string | Current state after ZAP/remediation |
| `IsFirstContact` | bool | True if sender has never emailed this recipient before |
| `SenderFromDomain` | string | Domain from the FROM header (visible to user) |
| `SenderMailFromDomain` | string | Domain from the envelope MAIL FROM (may differ) |
| `ForwardingInformation` | string | Present if email was auto-forwarded |

### Common Join Patterns

| Join | Left Table | Right Table | Join Key(s) |
|------|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| Email → URLs | `EmailEvents` | `EmailUrlInfo` | `NetworkMessageId` |
| Email → Attachments | `EmailEvents` | `EmailAttachmentInfo` | `NetworkMessageId` |
| Email → Post-Delivery | `EmailEvents` | `EmailPostDeliveryEvents` | `NetworkMessageId`, `RecipientEmailAddress` |
| Email → URL Clicks | `EmailEvents` | `UrlClickEvents` | `NetworkMessageId` |
| Email → Device Events | `EmailEvents` | `DeviceLogonEvents` | `AccountName` (extract from `RecipientEmailAddress`) |

### Known Pitfalls

| Field | Pitfall |
|-------|---------|
| `DetectionMethods` | JSON string, NOT dynamic — must `parse_json()` before accessing sub-keys |
| `AuthenticationDetails` | JSON string — must `parse_json()` before accessing DMARC/DKIM/SPF |
| `ThreatTypes` | String field — use `has` not `==` (values can be pipe-delimited) |
| `TimeGenerated` vs `Timestamp` | Data Lake uses `TimeGenerated`; Advanced Hunting uses `Timestamp` |
| `IsFirstContact` | May be null for non-inbound emails — always filter `EmailDirection == "Inbound"` first |
