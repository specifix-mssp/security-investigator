## Context

Based on [Microsoft Threat Intelligence blog (2026-04-07)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2026/04/07/soho-router-compromise-leads-to-dns-hijacking-and-adversary-in-the-middle-attacks/): Forest Blizzard (Russian military intelligence) and its sub-group Storm-2754 have been compromising vulnerable SOHO devices at scale since August 2025, modifying their DNS settings to redirect DNS traffic through actor-controlled infrastructure. Compromised routers push malicious DNS resolvers to connected Windows endpoints via DHCP, enabling passive DNS collection and selective TLS AiTM attacks against high-value targets (Microsoft Outlook on the web, government servers).

**Attack chain:**
1. SOHO router compromised → DNS settings modified (dnsmasq on port 53)
2. Connected endpoints receive malicious DNS via DHCP lease renewal
3. Actor passively collects DNS queries for reconnaissance
4. Selective AiTM against priority targets (spoofed TLS certificates for Microsoft 365 domains)

**Key detection surfaces in MDE telemetry:**
- `DeviceNetworkInfo.DnsAddresses` — Periodic snapshots of each device's configured DNS servers (the PRIMARY detection surface for DHCP-driven DNS hijacking)
- `DeviceNetworkEvents` — Port 53 outbound connections to unusual external resolvers
- `DeviceRegistryEvents` — DNS-related registry modifications (limited coverage for DHCP-driven changes)
- `DeviceProcessEvents` — Command-line DNS modification via netsh/PowerShell/wmic
- `EntraIdSignInEvents` — Post-compromise risky sign-ins from stolen credentials

## Queries

### Query 1: DNS Configuration Drift — Baseline vs Recent

**Purpose:** Detect devices whose DNS servers changed by comparing a 30-7d baseline against the most recent 7 days. This is the signature of a SOHO router compromise where the router's DHCP settings are modified to push actor-controlled DNS.  
**Severity:** Medium  
**MITRE:** T1584.002, T1557  
**Tuning Notes:** WSL2 NAT adapters (`172.x.x.1` pattern on virtual adapters) and VPN transitions (office ↔ home) will produce expected drift. Add `where not(NetworkAdapterName has "WSL")` and corporate-specific VPN adapter whitelists to reduce noise. Home workers changing Wi-Fi networks will show gateway DNS changes — correlate with the non-RFC1918 external DNS detections (Query 2/7) for higher-confidence findings.

| where not(set_has_element(BaselineDnsServers, RecentDnsStr))
| project LastSeen, DeviceName, NewDnsServer = RecentDnsStr, BaselineDnsServers, RecentDnsServers
| order by LastSeen desc
```

### Query 2: Non-Corporate External DNS Resolver Detection

**Purpose:** Flag devices configured with DNS servers that are external (non-RFC1918), not Azure Wire Server, and not well-known public DNS providers. In the Forest Blizzard campaign, compromised SOHO routers push actor-controlled external DNS IPs that don't match any well-known provider.  
**Severity:** High  
**MITRE:** T1584.002  
**Tuning Notes:** Add your organization's legitimate ISP DNS ranges and any corporate external resolvers to the exclusion list. IPv6 ISP DNS (e.g., `2001:558:feed::*` for Comcast, `2600:*` for various ISPs) should be evaluated per-environment. The query excludes well-known public DNS by IP — add public DoH/DoT provider IPs if relevant.

| extend DnsServer = tostring(DnsAddress)

    and DnsServer !startswith "127." 
    and DnsServer != "::1" 
    and DnsServer !startswith "fec0"

    "149.112.112.112", "208.67.222.222", "208.67.220.220", "4.2.2.1", "4.2.2.2")
// Exclude Azure Wire Server
| where DnsServer != "168.63.129.16"
// Flag non-RFC1918 (external) DNS servers — not internal, not well-known, not Azure
| where not(
    DnsServer startswith "10." or 
    DnsServer matches regex @"^172\.(1[6-9]|2[0-9]|3[01])\." or 
    DnsServer startswith "192.168.")
// Exclude IPv6 link-local (router advertisements)

    by DeviceName, DeviceId, DnsServer
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, DeviceId, DnsServer, DhcpServer = IPv4Dhcp, 
    NetworkAdapterName, DeviceCount
| order by Timestamp desc
```

---

### Query 3: DNS Server Change Timeline per Device

**Purpose:** Track DNS configuration changes over time for each device — creates a chronological timeline of every DNS server change. Essential for incident response: shows exactly when a device's DNS was modified (e.g., when DHCP lease from compromised router took effect).  
**Severity:** Informational  
**MITRE:** T1584.002  
**Tuning Notes:** The `serialize` + `prev()` pattern detects any change in the full DNS config string. Filter out known adapter cycling (WSL, VPN reconnects) by adding adapter-name exclusions. Reduce time granularity from `1h` bins to `4h` or `1d` for longer lookbacks.

<!-- cd-metadata

    by DeviceId, DeviceName, bin(Timestamp, 1h)
| extend DnsConfig = tostring(DnsAddresses)
| order by DeviceName asc, Timestamp asc
| serialize
| extend PrevDnsConfig = prev(DnsConfig), PrevDevice = prev(DeviceName)
| where DeviceName == PrevDevice and DnsConfig != PrevDnsConfig
| where isnotempty(PrevDnsConfig)
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, NewDns = DnsConfig, PreviousDns = PrevDnsConfig, 
    NetworkAdapterName, DhcpServer = IPv4Dhcp
| order by DeviceName asc, Timestamp asc
```

---

### Query 4: Suspicious DNS (Port 53) Traffic to Non-Standard Resolvers

**Purpose:** Detect devices sending DNS queries (port 53) to external IPs that are not well-known public DNS resolvers or internal infrastructure. Forest Blizzard's actor-controlled DNS servers listen on port 53 using dnsmasq.  
**Severity:** Medium  
**MITRE:** T1584.002, T1071.004  
**Tuning Notes:** DCs running `dns.exe` legitimately query root nameservers (192.48.79.30, 199.19.56.1, etc.) — exclude root hints or restrict to non-`dns.exe` processes. ISP DNS resolvers on remote worker devices will appear — add known ISP ranges or correlate with `DeviceNetworkInfo` to identify which DNS was DHCP-assigned vs manually configured.

    "149.112.112.112", "208.67.222.222", "208.67.220.220", "4.2.2.1", "4.2.2.2")
// Exclude Azure Wire Server and loopback
| where RemoteIP != "168.63.129.16" and RemoteIP !startswith "127."
// Exclude internal DNS and root nameservers (DCs query root hints legitimately)
| where not(RemoteIP startswith "10." or 
    RemoteIP matches regex @"^172\.(1[6-9]|2[0-9]|3[01])\." or 
    RemoteIP startswith "192.168.")
// Exclude DNS server processes querying root hints
| where InitiatingProcessFileName != "dns.exe"
| summarize 
    ConnectionCount = count(),
    DeviceCount = dcount(DeviceName),
    Devices = make_set(DeviceName, 20),
    Processes = make_set(InitiatingProcessFileName, 10),
    FirstSeen = min(Timestamp),
    LastSeen = max(Timestamp)
    by RemoteIP
| order by DeviceCount desc, ConnectionCount desc
```

---

### Query 5: DNS-Modifying Process Detection

**Purpose:** Detect command-line execution of tools that modify DNS settings (netsh, PowerShell Set-DnsClientServerAddress, wmic, reg.exe). While the Forest Blizzard campaign modifies DNS via DHCP (router-level), an attacker with endpoint access could also force DNS changes via these tools.  
**Severity:** High  
**MITRE:** T1584.002, T1112  
**Tuning Notes:** Low noise in managed environments — DNS changes via CLI are unusual. Legitimate IT scripts (e.g., VPN connection scripts) may trigger this. Add process parent whitelists for known management tools. The `ipconfig /flushdns` pattern is excluded (cache flush, not a DNS server change).

| where ProcessCommandLine has_any ("DnsClientServerAddress", "DhcpNameServer", 
    "NameServer", "dnsservers")
    and ProcessCommandLine has_any ("set", "add", "change", "new")
// Exclude DNS cache flush (benign)

| project Timestamp, DeviceName, DeviceId, FileName, ProcessCommandLine, 
    InitiatingProcessFileName, InitiatingProcessCommandLine, 
    AccountName = InitiatingProcessAccountName, ReportId
| order by Timestamp desc
```

### Query 6: Fleet DNS Anomaly — Rare DNS Servers

**Purpose:** Identify DNS servers that are used by very few devices in the fleet (≤2). In a SOHO DNS hijacking scenario, a compromised router only affects devices on that network segment — producing a DNS server seen by just 1-2 devices while the rest of the fleet uses corporate DNS.  
**Severity:** Medium  
**MITRE:** T1584.002  
**Tuning Notes:** Adjust the `DeviceCount <= 2` threshold based on fleet size. Larger fleets can increase to `<= 3`. Remote/home workers will have unique gateway DNS — correlate rare DNS servers with RFC1918 gateway addresses (192.168.x.1, 10.0.x.1) to identify home network DNS. The highest-priority findings are rare DNS servers that are ALSO external (non-RFC1918).

<!-- cd-metadata

```kql
// Fleet DNS Anomaly — Rare DNS Servers (used by ≤2 devices)

    DnsServer startswith "192.168.")
| order by IsExternal desc, DeviceCount asc
```

### Query 7: DHCP-Assigned External DNS — The SOHO Router TTP

**Purpose:** The highest-fidelity query for the Forest Blizzard TTP. Specifically detects DHCP-configured interfaces where the DHCP server assigned non-well-known external DNS resolvers. This is exactly what happens when a compromised SOHO router serves malicious DNS to connected endpoints.  
**Severity:** High  
**MITRE:** T1584.002, T1557  
**Tuning Notes:** This query requires the DHCP field (`IPv4Dhcp`) to be populated — only works for DHCP-configured IPv4 adapters. ISP DNS resolvers assigned by home ISP routers will appear (legitimate). Add known ISP DNS ranges per geography to reduce noise. The combination of DHCP server = typical home gateway (192.168.1.1) + unknown external DNS = strongest indicator.

### Query 8: Post-Compromise AiTM — High-Risk Sign-Ins

**Purpose:** Hunt for post-compromise activity after DNS hijacking enables AiTM. Forest Blizzard steals credentials via TLS AiTM then accesses cloud resources as a legitimate user. This query (adapted from the Microsoft blog) surfaces high-risk sign-ins that may indicate stolen credential use.  
**Severity:** High  
**MITRE:** T1557, T1078  
**Tuning Notes:** `RiskLevelDuringSignIn == 100` is the highest risk. ErrorCode 0 = successful sign-in, 50140 = "This occurred due to 'Keep me signed in' interrupt" (token refresh). Correlate with the DNS hijacking queries above — if a device had its DNS modified AND the user has high-risk sign-ins, prioritize investigation.

> **Note:** The Microsoft blog used `AADSignInEventsBeta` which is deprecated (Dec 2025). This query uses `EntraIdSignInEvents` (the replacement table). Ensure correct casing: capital `I` in `SignIn`.

### Query 9: Post-Compromise Mailbox Access — Search and MailItemsAccessed

**Purpose:** Detect post-compromise activity where an attacker (using stolen credentials from AiTM) searches mailboxes or accesses sensitive email items. Forest Blizzard targets Outlook on the web specifically.  
**Severity:** High  
**MITRE:** T1114.002, T1557  
**Tuning Notes:** Scope to specific suspicious user accounts (fill in `AccountObjectId`). Without scoping, this returns all search/mail access events across the organization. Cross-reference with Query 8 results to identify users with risky sign-ins.

### Common Legitimate DNS Patterns to Exclude

| DNS Server | Purpose | Notes |
|------------|---------|-------|
| `10.x.x.x`, `172.16-31.x.x`, `192.168.x.x` | Corporate/internal DNS | Add your org's specific IPs to allowlists |
| `168.63.129.16` | Azure Wire Server | Standard for Azure VMs — always exclude |
| `8.8.8.8`, `8.8.4.4` | Google Public DNS | Well-known, generally safe |
| `1.1.1.1`, `1.0.0.1` | Cloudflare DNS | Well-known, generally safe |
| `9.9.9.9`, `149.112.112.112` | Quad9 DNS | Threat-blocking resolver |
| `208.67.222.222`, `208.67.220.220` | OpenDNS (Cisco) | Well-known, generally safe |
| `4.2.2.1`, `4.2.2.2` | Level3/CenturyLink DNS | Legacy but common |
| `127.0.0.1`, `::1` | Loopback | DCs point to themselves |
| `172.x.x.1` (WSL adapters) | WSL2 NAT gateway | Hyper-V virtual networking |
| `fe80::*` | IPv6 link-local | Router advertisements |
| `fec0:0:0:ffff::*` | IPv6 site-local | Legacy, VPN fallback |

## Investigation Playbook

When any of the queries above return results:

1. **Triage** — Identify which devices show DNS anomalies
2. **Correlate** — Check if the same devices have high-risk sign-ins (Query 8)
3. **Enrich** — Run the suspicious DNS server IPs through threat intelligence (`enrich_ips.py`)
4. **Verify** — Check `DeviceNetworkInfo` DHCP server field to identify the upstream router
5. **Scope** — Determine if multiple devices share the same DHCP server (indicating router compromise vs single device)
6. **Remediate** — Reset DNS settings, investigate/replace compromised SOHO router, force password reset for affected users, revoke sessions
