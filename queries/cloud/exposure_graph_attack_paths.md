## 📋 Overview

This guide covers two approaches for analyzing the Exposure Management attack surface:

1. **Sentinel Graph MCP Tools** (recommended first pass) — purpose-built blast radius, exposure perimeter, walkable path, and connected node tools that return structured multi-hop results instantly. Start here for rapid triage.
2. **KQL Queries** (deep dive / reference) — 32 production-ready queries against `ExposureGraphNodes` and `ExposureGraphEdges` tables in Advanced Hunting, plus Azure Resource Graph queries. Use these for custom analysis, fleet-wide sweeps, and scenarios the MCP tools don't cover.

---

## 🚀 Sentinel Graph MCP Tools — Recommended First Pass

The Sentinel Exposure Graph MCP server provides four specialized tools that operate directly on the ExposureGraph. These are **faster and more effective** than raw KQL for common attack path scenarios — they handle multi-hop traversal, permission chain resolution, and criticality correlation automatically.

**When to use MCP tools vs KQL:**

| Scenario | Use MCP Tools | Use KQL |
|----------|---------------|---------|
| "What can this compromised device reach?" | `graph_find_blastradius` | — |
| "What's exposed to the internet that can reach this target?" | `graph_exposure_perimeter` | — |
| "Show the full path from device A to resource B" | `graph_find_walkable_paths` | — |
| "What storage accounts are 2 hops from this VM?" | `graph_find_connected_nodes` | — |
| Fleet-wide critical asset inventory | — | Query 1–4 |
| Cookie chain analysis across all devices | — | Queries 21–25 |
| Choke point detection (users in most paths) | — | Query 30 |
| Permission role distribution across all paths | — | Queries 26–28 |
| Azure Resource Graph pre-computed attack paths | — | Queries 31–32 |
| Custom multi-join analysis or aggregation | — | Any custom KQL |

### Tool 1: `graph_find_blastradius`

**Purpose:** Given a source asset (device, identity, etc.), discover all downstream targets reachable via walkable edges (managed identity auth, permissions, cookie chains, group membership). Returns full multi-hop paths with criticality, risk score, and vulnerability status at each node.

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `sourceName` | Yes | Name of the source node (e.g., `alpine-srv1`, a username, a SPN name) |

**Example:**
```
graph_find_blastradius(sourceName="alpine-srv1")
```

**Returns:** Array of walkable paths, each containing ordered steps:
- `StepIndex` — hop number (0 = source)
- `SourceNodeName/Label` → `EdgeLabel` → `TargetNodeName/Label`
- `Criticality` — target asset criticality level (0 = highest)
- `HasVulnerabilities` — whether target has known CVEs

**Typical attack chains discovered:**
```
Device → can authenticate as → ManagedIdentity → has permissions to → StorageAccount (Contributor)
Device → contains → entra-userCookie → can authenticate as → User → has permissions to → KeyVault
```

**When results are most valuable:**
- Source device is under active attack (brute-force, anomalous behavior)
- Source device has high-severity CVEs (entry point for exploitation)
- Investigating blast radius after a confirmed compromise

---

### Tool 2: `graph_exposure_perimeter`

**Purpose:** Given a target asset, find the **inbound exposure perimeter** — the set of internet-facing or externally-reachable nodes that have walkable paths TO the target. This is the inverse of blast radius: "what entry points can reach this critical asset?"

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `targetName` | Yes | Name of the target node to find exposure paths to |

**Example:**
```
graph_exposure_perimeter(targetName="main-dc.zava-corp.com")
```

**Returns:** Array of perimeter nodes with:
- `NodeName/Label` — the externally-reachable entry point
- `Criticality`, `RiskScore`, `HasVulnerabilities`
- `NumberOfAllNeighbours` — connectivity degree
- `Edges` — the edges connecting this perimeter node

**Known limitation:** This tool may return empty results for assets that ARE network-reachable (confirmed via public IP routing and brute-force traffic) but don't have formal ExposureGraph perimeter classification. When empty, fall back to KQL edge analysis:
```kql
ExposureGraphEdges
| where TargetNodeName == "<asset>"
| where EdgeLabel == "routes traffic to"
| project SourceNodeName, SourceNodeLabel
```

---

### Tool 3: `graph_find_walkable_paths`

**Purpose:** Find the specific walkable path(s) between a known source and a known target. Returns full node and edge detail including RBAC role assignments on permission edges.

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `sourceName` | Yes | Source node name |
| `targetName` | Yes | Target node name |

**Example:**
```
graph_find_walkable_paths(sourceName="alpine-srv1", targetName="mdcd4aistorage1")
```

**Returns:** Ordered nodes and edges with full permission detail:
- Each node includes `Criticality`, `RiskScore`, `NumberOfAllNeighbours`
- Permission edges include `roles[]` with role name, actions, dataActions, and roleAssignmentId
- Flags like `isOverProvisioned` and `isIdentityInactive` on connected identities

**Best for:** Validating a suspected attack path end-to-end, documenting the exact permission chain for remediation, identifying over-provisioned identities along the path.

---

### Tool 4: `graph_find_connected_nodes`

**Purpose:** Find all nodes of a specific type within N hops of a source node. Useful for discovering what resources a compromised asset can reach by type (storage accounts, VMs, key vaults, etc.).

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `sourceName` | Yes | Source node name |
| `sourceNodeLabel` | Yes | Source node type (e.g., `microsoft.compute/virtualmachines`) |
| `targetNodeLabel` | Yes | Target node type to search for (e.g., `microsoft.storage/storageaccounts`) |
| `maxHops` | Yes | Maximum traversal depth (1–3 recommended; higher = very large result sets) |

**Example:**
```
graph_find_connected_nodes(
    sourceName="alpine-srv1",
    sourceNodeLabel="microsoft.compute/virtualmachines",
    targetNodeLabel="microsoft.storage/storageaccounts",
    maxHops=2
)
```

**Returns:** All matching target nodes with full edge detail, including:
- Permission roles and whether identities are over-provisioned or inactive
- Group memberships and role inheritance chains
- Criticality levels on discovered nodes

**⚠️ Large result sets:** With `maxHops=2` on connected assets, this can return 1MB+ of data. Use targeted `targetNodeLabel` filters to constrain results.

---

### Tool 5: `graph_get_context`

**Purpose:** Retrieve the full graph schema — all node types, edge types, and their relationships. Use this before querying if you need to discover available `NodeLabel` or `EdgeLabel` values.

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `GraphName` | Yes | Always use `SystemScenarioEKGGraph` |

**Example:**
```
graph_get_context(GraphName="SystemScenarioEKGGraph")
```

---

### Recommended MCP Workflow for Asset Investigation

When investigating a specific asset (e.g., a device under attack, a compromised identity):

1. **Blast radius first:** `graph_find_blastradius(sourceName="<asset>")` — what can it reach?
2. **Exposure perimeter:** `graph_exposure_perimeter(targetName="<asset>")` — what entry points lead here?
3. **Specific paths:** If blast radius reveals a critical target, `graph_find_walkable_paths(sourceName="<asset>", targetName="<critical-target>")` — get the full chain with permissions
4. **Type-specific discovery:** `graph_find_connected_nodes(...)` — find all key vaults, storage accounts, or VMs within reach
5. **Deep dive:** Use the KQL queries below for fleet-wide analysis, custom joins, or scenarios not covered by the MCP tools

## 🔑 Key Concepts

### Criticality Levels
- **Level 0-1**: Most critical assets (domain controllers, high-value servers)
- **Level 2-3**: High priority assets
- **Level 4+**: Standard assets
- **Lower number = Higher criticality**

### Node Categories
Common categories you'll see:
- `device` - Physical or virtual devices
- `virtual_machine` - Cloud VMs
- `identity` - User accounts and service principals
- `ip_address` - Network addresses
- `compute` - Compute resources

### Edge Labels (Relationships)
Common edge types (by volume):
- `has permissions to` - Azure RBAC role assignments to resources
- `affecting` - CVE vulnerabilities affecting assets
- `member of` - Group membership relationships
- `has role on` - Role assignments (often via groups)
- `contains` - Parent contains child (e.g., device → entra-userCookie)
- `can authenticate as` - Identity impersonation via cached credentials
- `Can Authenticate As` - Authentication relationships (on-prem/identity)
- `CanRemoteInteractiveLogonTo` - Remote login permissions
- `has credentials of` - Device has stored credentials for a user
- `frequently logged in by` - Device frequently used by a user

### Node Property Reference — Key Security Properties

**Devices (`NodeProperties.rawData`):**

| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `highRiskVulnerabilityInsights` | dynamic | Vulnerability summary — the PRIMARY property for attack path entry points |
| `highRiskVulnerabilityInsights.hasHighOrCritical` | bool | Device has high/critical severity CVEs |
| `highRiskVulnerabilityInsights.maxCvssScore` | real | Highest CVSS score across all CVEs on device |
| `highRiskVulnerabilityInsights.vulnerableToRemoteCodeExecution` | bool | Device has RCE-exploitable CVEs |
| `highRiskVulnerabilityInsights.vulnerableToPrivilegeEscalation` | bool | Device has privesc-exploitable CVEs |
| `highRiskVulnerabilityInsights.explotabilityLevels` | dynamic | Breakdown of exploitability categories |
| `criticalityLevel` | dynamic | Nested object: `{criticalityLevel: int, ruleNames: [...]}` |
| `exposureScore` | real | Device exposure score (0-100) |
| `riskScore` | real | Device risk score (0-100) |
| `publicIP` | string | Public IP if internet-facing |
| `IsInternetFacing` | bool | Legacy internet-facing flag |
| `exposedToInternet` | bool | Current internet-facing flag |

> ⚠️ **PITFALL**: `vulnerableToRCE` and `hasVulnerabilities` do NOT reliably exist as top-level properties on most devices. Always use `highRiskVulnerabilityInsights` instead. The legacy `vulnerableToRCE` property exists only on a subset of nodes.

**Users (`NodeProperties.rawData`):**

| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `criticalityLevel` | dynamic | Nested JSON: `{type, criticalityLevel: int, ruleBasedCriticalityLevel: int, ruleNames: [...]}` |
| `assignedRoles` | dynamic | Entra ID directory roles assigned to user |
| `accountEnabled` | bool | Whether account is active |
| `isActive` | bool | Recent activity flag |
| `accountUpn` | string | User Principal Name |
| `hasLeakedCredentials` | bool | Identity Protection leaked credentials flag |
| `hasAdLeakedCredentials` | bool | AD-sourced leaked credentials flag |

> ⚠️ **PITFALL**: User `criticalityLevel` is a nested JSON string, NOT a plain integer. You must use `parse_json(tostring(NodeProperties.rawData.criticalityLevel)).criticalityLevel` to extract the numeric level.

**Storage Accounts (`NodeProperties.rawData`):**

| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `containsSensitiveData` | bool | Purview classification: contains sensitive data |
| `exposedToInternet` | bool | Storage account is publicly accessible |
| `criticalityLevel` | int | Asset criticality (plain int, not nested) |

**Edge Properties (`EdgeProperties.rawData`):**

| Edge Label | Key Property | Description |
|------------|-------------|-------------|
| `has permissions to` | `permissions.roles[]` | Array of RBAC roles: `{name, id, roleAssignmentId, actions, dataActions}` |
| `has permissions to` | `permissions.evidence` | Node IDs and edge IDs forming the permission chain |

### entra-userCookie — The Attack Path Pivot

The `entra-userCookie` node type represents a **cached Entra ID authentication token** stored on a device. This is the critical pivot in identity-based attack paths:

```
Device (compromised) → contains → entra-userCookie → can authenticate as → User → has permissions to → Azure Resource
```

**Attack scenario**: If an attacker compromises a device with high-severity vulnerabilities, they can extract cached authentication cookies to impersonate the logged-in user and access any Azure resource that user has permissions to — **without needing the user's password or MFA**.

This maps to MITRE ATT&CK:
- **T1539**: Steal Web Session Cookie
- **T1550.004**: Use Alternate Authentication Material: Web Session Cookie

```

**Use this to understand what's tracked** before building more complex queries.

---

### Find All Relationship Types

```kql
ExposureGraphEdges
| summarize EdgeCount = count() by EdgeLabel
| order by EdgeCount desc
```

**Use this to understand what connections exist** in your attack surface.

## 📊 Multi-Cloud Inventory

```kql
ExposureGraphNodes
| where NodeLabel contains "microsoft.compute" or NodeLabel contains "aws." or NodeLabel contains "gcp."
| extend CloudProvider = case(
    NodeLabel contains "microsoft.compute", "Azure",
    NodeLabel contains "aws.", "AWS",
    NodeLabel contains "gcp.", "GCP",
    "Other"
)
| summarize 
    ResourceCount = count(),
    SampleResources = make_set(NodeName, 5)
    by CloudProvider, NodeLabel
| order by CloudProvider asc, ResourceCount desc
```

**Sample Results:**
```
CloudProvider  NodeLabel                                ResourceCount  SampleResources
Azure         microsoft.compute/virtualmachines/ext...  279           [MicrosoftMonitoringAgent, AzurePolicyforWindows, ...]
Azure         microsoft.compute/virtualmachines        92            [vnevado-proxy, D4IoT, w11-gsa, ...]
GCP           gcp.serviceaccount                       91            [microsoft-defender-cspm@..., ...]
```

## 🔗 Graph Query Pattern

Attack path queries use the `make-graph` and `graph-match` operators:

```kql
// Step 1: Filter nodes to reduce graph size
let FilteredNodes = ExposureGraphNodes
| where <filter conditions>;

// Step 2: Build graph structure
ExposureGraphEdges
| make-graph SourceNodeId --> TargetNodeId with FilteredNodes on NodeId

// Step 3: Match patterns
| graph-match (SourceNode)-[edge]->(TargetNode)
    where <pattern conditions>
    project <output columns>
```

**Key points:**
- Filter nodes FIRST (performance)
- Use `make-graph` to create graph structure
- Use `graph-match` with pattern matching syntax
- Arrow syntax: `(Node1)-[edge]->(Node2)` means "Node1 connects to Node2"
- Use `*1..3` for multi-hop paths: `(A)-[edge*1..3]->(B)`

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Data Source
- These queries run in **Defender XDR Advanced Hunting** (NOT Sentinel Data Lake)
- Use the `RunAdvancedHuntingQuery` tool from the Sentinel Triage MCP server
- Tables available: ExposureGraphNodes, ExposureGraphEdges, Device*, Alert*, Email*, etc.

### Timestamp Differences
- **Advanced Hunting**: Uses `Timestamp` column
- **Sentinel Data Lake**: Uses `TimeGenerated` column
- ExposureGraph tables may not have timestamp columns (they represent current state)

### Performance Tips
- **Filter early**: Reduce nodes before graph operations
- **Use `take`**: Limit results during development
- **Test incrementally**: Start simple, add complexity gradually
- **Avoid `*`**: Project only needed columns

### Data Freshness
- Exposure graph data updates periodically (not real-time)
- Attack paths are recalculated as environment changes
- Check node properties for last update timestamps

---

## 🎓 Example Workflow: Investigating Critical Asset Exposure

**Scenario**: Security team needs to assess risk of critical assets exposed to attack paths

### Step 1: Identify Critical Assets
```kql
// Query 1 - Get all critical devices
ExposureGraphNodes
| where set_has_element(Categories, "device")
| where isnotnull(NodeProperties.rawData.criticalityLevel)
| where NodeProperties.rawData.criticalityLevel.criticalityLevel < 4
```

### Step 2: Check Internet Exposure
```kql
// Query 2 - Filter for internet-facing
ExposureGraphNodes
| where set_has_element(Categories, "device")
| where isnotnull(NodeProperties.rawData.criticalityLevel)
| where NodeProperties.rawData.criticalityLevel.criticalityLevel < 4
| where isnotnull(NodeProperties.rawData.IsInternetFacing)
```

### Step 3: Identify Vulnerabilities
```kql
// Query 11 - CVEs affecting critical devices
let CriticalDeviceIds = ExposureGraphNodes
| where set_has_element(Categories, "device")
| where isnotnull(NodeProperties.rawData.criticalityLevel)
| where NodeProperties.rawData.criticalityLevel.criticalityLevel < 4
| project NodeId, DeviceName = NodeName;
ExposureGraphEdges
| where EdgeLabel == "affecting"
| where SourceNodeLabel == "Cve"
| join kind=inner CriticalDeviceIds on $left.TargetNodeId == $right.NodeId
| project DeviceName, CVE = SourceNodeName
```

### Step 4: Map Attack Paths
See **Query 6** below in the complete query library for multi-hop attack path detection.

### Step 5: Prioritize Remediation
1. Focus on critical assets (level 0-1)
2. Prioritize internet-exposed assets
3. Address assets with most CVEs first
4. Consider attack path choke points

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Start with exploration queries** (13-16) to understand your environment
2. **Filter by criticality level < 2** for highest priority assets
3. **Combine with other Defender tables** (AlertEvidence, DeviceTvmSoftwareVulnerabilities)
4. **Save queries as hunting rules** for continuous monitoring
5. **Use graph-match for complex attack paths** instead of multiple joins
6. **Check NodeProperties.rawData** for rich security context
7. **Correlate with SecurityIncident table** to find active threats to critical assets
8. **Use `highRiskVulnerabilityInsights`** not `vulnerableToRCE` for vulnerability filtering — the former is reliably populated on devices
9. **User criticality is nested JSON** — always `parse_json(tostring(...))` before extracting `criticalityLevel`
10. **Edge properties contain RBAC roles** — parse `EdgeProperties.rawData.permissions.roles` for Owner/Contributor/Secrets analysis
11. **Two attack path sources exist** — ExposureGraph (identity-based device→user→resource) and Azure Resource Graph (cloud-native internet-exposed→resource)
12. **Union direct + group-mediated paths** for comprehensive coverage — group membership adds ~15-25% more paths

### SECTION 9: Vulnerable Device Attack Paths — Cookie Chain Analysis

> **Core concept**: When a device has high-severity vulnerabilities, an attacker who compromises it can extract cached `entra-userCookie` tokens to impersonate logged-in users and pivot to ANY Azure resource those users have permissions on — without needing the user's password or MFA. These queries map that blast radius.

#### Query 21: Devices with High-Risk Vulnerability Insights (Entry Points)

**Description**: Find all devices flagged with high-risk vulnerability insights — the entry points for identity-based attack paths  
**Use Case**: Identify the device population that feeds into attack path analysis  
**Key Property**: `NodeProperties.rawData.highRiskVulnerabilityInsights`

> **⚠️ PITFALL**: Do NOT use `NodeProperties.rawData.vulnerableToRCE` or `NodeProperties.rawData.hasVulnerabilities` — these legacy properties exist only on a subset of devices. The `highRiskVulnerabilityInsights` object is the reliable, comprehensive property. Always check `hasHighOrCritical` within it.

**Use Case**: Get accurate path counts that approximate what the Defender portal shows  
**Customization**: Change `TargetNodeLabelFilter` for different resource types

-->
```kql
// Comprehensive: Union direct + group-mediated paths for total unique pairs
// Change TargetNodeLabelFilter below for different resource types
let TargetNodeLabelFilter = "microsoft.keyvault/vaults";
let VulnDeviceIds = ExposureGraphNodes
| where set_has_element(Categories, "device")
| where isnotnull(NodeProperties.rawData.highRiskVulnerabilityInsights)
| project NodeId;
// Pattern A: 3-hop direct (Device→N1→N2→Target)
let ThreeHop = ExposureGraphEdges
| make-graph SourceNodeId --> TargetNodeId with ExposureGraphNodes on NodeId
| graph-match (Device)-[e1]->(N1)-[e2]->(N2)-[e3]->(Target)
    where set_has_element(Device.Categories, "device") and
        Target.NodeLabel =~ TargetNodeLabelFilter
    project DeviceId = Device.NodeId, DeviceName = Device.NodeName, TargetName = Target.NodeName
| join kind=inner VulnDeviceIds on $left.DeviceId == $right.NodeId
| distinct DeviceName, TargetName;
// Pattern B: 4-hop via group (Device→N1→N2→N3→Target)
let FourHop = ExposureGraphEdges
| make-graph SourceNodeId --> TargetNodeId with ExposureGraphNodes on NodeId
| graph-match (Device)-[e1]->(N1)-[e2]->(N2)-[e3]->(N3)-[e4]->(Target)
    where set_has_element(Device.Categories, "device") and
        Target.NodeLabel =~ TargetNodeLabelFilter
    project DeviceId = Device.NodeId, DeviceName = Device.NodeName, TargetName = Target.NodeName
| join kind=inner VulnDeviceIds on $left.DeviceId == $right.NodeId
| distinct DeviceName, TargetName;
union ThreeHop, FourHop
| distinct DeviceName, TargetName
| summarize TotalUniquePathPairs = count()
```

> **Portal reconciliation note**: The Defender portal counts attack path "instances" using a proprietary deduplication engine. Your KQL counts may differ by 5-10% because the portal may use additional intermediary patterns or different deduplication logic. Getting within 90-95% match is expected.

### SECTION 10: Attack Path Permission Analysis

> These queries show not just that a path EXISTS, but what PERMISSIONS the attacker would gain. An attack path to Key Vault with `Reader` is very different from one with `Key Vault Secrets Officer`.

#### Query 26: Permission Role Breakdown on Attack Paths

**Description**: Break down RBAC roles on attack path edges to show what permissions users actually have on target resources  
**Use Case**: Distinguish low-risk (Reader) from critical (Owner/Secrets Officer) attack paths  
**Customization**: Change the `TargetNodeLabelFilter` for different resource types

<!-- cd-metadata
cd_ready: false
adaptation_notes: "ExposureGraph snapshot data with parameter substitution (let TargetNodeLabelFilter). Point-in-time RBAC analysis, not event-driven."
-->
```kql
// Change target filter below for different resource types
let TargetNodeLabelFilter = "microsoft.keyvault/vaults";
let VulnDeviceIds = ExposureGraphNodes
| where set_has_element(Categories, "device")
| where isnotnull(NodeProperties.rawData.highRiskVulnerabilityInsights)
| project NodeId;
ExposureGraphEdges
| where EdgeLabel == "has permissions to"
| where TargetNodeId in (
    (ExposureGraphNodes | where NodeLabel =~ TargetNodeLabelFilter | project NodeId)
)
| extend roles = parse_json(tostring(EdgeProperties.rawData)).permissions.roles
| mv-expand role = roles
| extend RoleName = tostring(role.name)
| join kind=inner (
    ExposureGraphEdges
    | make-graph SourceNodeId --> TargetNodeId with ExposureGraphNodes on NodeId
    | graph-match (Device)-[e1]->(Cookie)-[e2]->(User)
        where set_has_element(Device.Categories, "device") and
            Cookie.NodeLabel =~ "entra-userCookie" and User.NodeLabel =~ "user"
        project DeviceId = Device.NodeId, UserId = User.NodeId
    | join kind=inner VulnDeviceIds on $left.DeviceId == $right.NodeId
    | distinct UserId
) on $left.SourceNodeId == $right.UserId
| summarize PathCount = count(), UniqueUsers = dcount(SourceNodeId), UniqueTargets = dcount(TargetNodeId) 
    by RoleName
| order by PathCount desc
```

**Risk interpretation for Key Vault roles:**

| Role | Risk | Can Access Secrets? |
|------|------|-------------------|
| 🔴 Key Vault Secrets Officer | Critical | Read, write, delete ALL secrets |
| 🔴 Key Vault Secrets User | Critical | Read ALL secrets |
| 🔴 Owner | Critical | Full control including IAM |
| 🟠 Contributor | High | Write access, can modify config |
| 🟡 Reader | Low | Metadata only, cannot read secrets |

#### Query 27: High-Privilege Users Reachable via Attack Paths

**Description**: Identify users with Owner, Contributor, or Secrets access to resources who are reachable from vulnerable devices  
**Use Case**: Highest-priority remediation — these attack paths grant dangerous write/admin access  
**Customization**: Change the `TargetNodeLabelFilter` and role filter list for different resource types

<!-- cd-metadata
cd_ready: false
adaptation_notes: "ExposureGraph snapshot data with parameter substitution (let TargetNodeLabelFilter). Point-in-time privilege analysis, not event-driven."

    | make-graph SourceNodeId --> TargetNodeId with ExposureGraphNodes on NodeId
    | graph-match (Device)-[e1]->(Cookie)-[e2]->(User)
        where set_has_element(Device.Categories, "device") and

        project DeviceId = Device.NodeId, DeviceName = Device.NodeName, 
            UserId = User.NodeId, UserName = User.NodeName
    | join kind=inner VulnDeviceIds on $left.DeviceId == $right.NodeId
    | distinct UserId, UserName, DeviceName
) on $left.SourceNodeId == $right.UserId
| join kind=inner (
    ExposureGraphNodes | where NodeLabel =~ TargetNodeLabelFilter 
    | project TargetNodeId = NodeId, TargetName = NodeName
) on TargetNodeId
| summarize 
    Roles = make_set(RoleName), 
    TargetCount = dcount(TargetName), 
    Targets = make_set(TargetName), 
    Devices = make_set(DeviceName) 
    by UserName
| order by TargetCount desc
```

#### Query 28: Critical Users (by Entra Criticality) Reachable from Vulnerable Devices

**Description**: Find users with high Entra ID criticality levels (Global Admins, Security Admins, etc.) who are reachable from devices with high-severity vulnerabilities  
**Use Case**: THE most dangerous attack paths — compromising these users grants broad tenant-level access

<!-- cd-metadata
cd_ready: false
adaptation_notes: "ExposureGraph snapshot data — point-in-time critical user reachability analysis. Not event-driven; CD requires temporal detection."
-->
```kql
let VulnDeviceIds = ExposureGraphNodes
| where set_has_element(Categories, "device")
| where isnotnull(NodeProperties.rawData.highRiskVulnerabilityInsights)
| project NodeId;
ExposureGraphEdges
| make-graph SourceNodeId --> TargetNodeId with ExposureGraphNodes on NodeId
| graph-match (Device)-[e1]->(Cookie)-[e2]->(User)
    where set_has_element(Device.Categories, "device") and
        Cookie.NodeLabel =~ "entra-userCookie" and User.NodeLabel =~ "user"
    project DeviceId = Device.NodeId, DeviceName = Device.NodeName, 
        UserName = User.NodeName, 
        UserCritRaw = tostring(User.NodeProperties.rawData.criticalityLevel),
        MaxCvss = toreal(Device.NodeProperties.rawData.highRiskVulnerabilityInsights.maxCvssScore)
| join kind=inner VulnDeviceIds on $left.DeviceId == $right.NodeId
| where isnotempty(UserCritRaw) and UserCritRaw != "{}"
| extend UserCritLevel = toint(parse_json(UserCritRaw).criticalityLevel),
    CritRules = tostring(parse_json(UserCritRaw).ruleNames)
| distinct DeviceName, UserName, UserCritLevel, CritRules, MaxCvss
| order by UserCritLevel asc, UserName asc
```

**Criticality levels (lower = more critical):**

| Level | Meaning | Typical Roles |
|-------|---------|---------------|
| 🔴 0 | Highest criticality | Global Administrator, highly critical assets |
| 🟠 1 | High criticality | Security Admin, Compliance Admin, SharePoint Admin |
| 🟡 2-3 | Medium criticality | Various admin roles |

> **Remediation priority**: A criticality-0 user (Global Admin) reachable from a CVSS 9.8 device is an **immediate, critical risk**. The attacker gains full tenant control by compromising a single vulnerable endpoint.

> **⚠️ PITFALL**: User `criticalityLevel` is a nested JSON string, NOT a plain integer. You must use `parse_json(tostring(...)).criticalityLevel` to extract the numeric level. Direct `toint()` on the raw property will return null.

### SECTION 11: Attack Path Entry Points & Choke Points

#### Query 29: Top Entry-Point Devices by Blast Radius

**Description**: Rank vulnerable devices by how many unique Azure resources an attacker could reach by compromising them  
**Use Case**: Prioritize vulnerability remediation by actual impact — a device reaching 465 targets is more urgent than one reaching 10

<!-- cd-metadata

        not(Target.NodeLabel in~ ("user", "group", "entra-userCookie", "serviceprincipal"))
    project DeviceId = Device.NodeId, DeviceName = Device.NodeName, 
        UserName = User.NodeName,
        TargetName = Target.NodeName, TargetLabel = Target.NodeLabel
| join kind=inner VulnDeviceIds on $left.DeviceId == $right.NodeId
| summarize 
    UniqueTargets = dcount(TargetName),
    UniqueUsers = dcount(UserName),
    TargetTypes = make_set(TargetLabel),
    KVs = dcountif(TargetName, TargetLabel =~ "microsoft.keyvault/vaults"),
    OpenAI = dcountif(TargetName, TargetLabel =~ "microsoft.cognitiveservices/accounts"),
    Storage = dcountif(TargetName, TargetLabel =~ "microsoft.storage/storageaccounts")
    by DeviceName, MaxCvss
| order by UniqueTargets desc
| take 20
```

#### Query 30: Choke Point Detection — Users in Most Attack Paths

**Description**: Find users who appear as identity pivots in the most attack paths — these are choke points where remediation has maximum impact  
**Use Case**: Locking down credentials for a top choke-point user blocks MANY attack paths at once

<!-- cd-metadata
cd_ready: false
adaptation_notes: "ExposureGraph snapshot data — point-in-time choke point identification. Not event-driven; CD requires temporal detection."
-->
```kql
let VulnDeviceIds = ExposureGraphNodes
| where set_has_element(Categories, "device")
| where isnotnull(NodeProperties.rawData.highRiskVulnerabilityInsights)
| project NodeId;
ExposureGraphEdges
| make-graph SourceNodeId --> TargetNodeId with ExposureGraphNodes on NodeId
| graph-match (Device)-[e1]->(Cookie)-[e2]->(User)-[e3]->(Target)
    where set_has_element(Device.Categories, "device") and
        Cookie.NodeLabel =~ "entra-userCookie" and User.NodeLabel =~ "user" and
        not(Target.NodeLabel in~ ("user", "group", "entra-userCookie", "serviceprincipal"))
    project DeviceId = Device.NodeId, DeviceName = Device.NodeName, 
        UserName = User.NodeName, TargetName = Target.NodeName,
        UserCritRaw = tostring(User.NodeProperties.rawData.criticalityLevel)
| join kind=inner VulnDeviceIds on $left.DeviceId == $right.NodeId
| summarize 
    UniqueTargets = dcount(TargetName),
    UniqueDevices = dcount(DeviceName),
    TotalPaths = count(),
    UserCritRaw = take_any(UserCritRaw)
    by UserName
| extend UserCritLevel = toint(parse_json(UserCritRaw).criticalityLevel),
    CritRules = tostring(parse_json(UserCritRaw).ruleNames)
| project UserName, UserCritLevel, CritRules, UniqueTargets, UniqueDevices, TotalPaths
| order by UniqueTargets desc
| take 15
```

**Remediation actions for choke points:**
1. 🔴 Enforce phishing-resistant MFA (FIDO2/passkeys) for all choke-point users
2. 🔴 Enable token protection / CAE continuous access evaluation
3. 🟠 Reduce standing permissions — convert to PIM-eligible with approval workflows
4. 🟠 Apply Conditional Access: require compliant/managed devices for privileged access
5. 🟡 Monitor choke-point users with custom Sentinel analytics rules for anomalous sign-ins

### SECTION 12: Azure Resource Graph — Pre-Computed Attack Paths

> **Two complementary data sources**: ExposureGraph (Sections 9-11 above) covers identity-based attack paths from devices through users to cloud resources. Azure Resource Graph covers **pre-computed cloud-native attack paths** from internet-exposed entry points to critical resources. Together they provide complete coverage.

> **⚠️ Execution note**: These are NOT KQL queries for Advanced Hunting. They run via Azure CLI `az graph query` against the Azure Resource Graph.

#### Query 31: All Pre-Computed Attack Paths from Azure Resource Graph

**Description**: Retrieve all attack paths pre-computed by Microsoft Defender for Cloud  
**Use Case**: Get named attack scenarios with descriptions, attack stories, and remediation guidance  
**Execution**: Azure CLI (not Advanced Hunting)

<!-- cd-metadata
cd_ready: false
adaptation_notes: "Azure Resource Graph CLI query (az graph query) — not KQL for Defender XDR Advanced Hunting. Runs against ARM, not applicable for CD."
-->
```bash
az graph query -q "
  securityresources
  | where type == 'microsoft.security/attackpaths'
  | extend DisplayName = tostring(properties.displayName),
      Description = tostring(properties.description),
      AttackStory = tostring(properties.attackStory),
      EntryPointType = tostring(properties.graphComponent.entryPointEntityType),
      TargetType = tostring(properties.graphComponent.targetEntityType)
  | project DisplayName, Description, AttackStory, EntryPointType, TargetType, properties
  | order by DisplayName asc
" --first 1000
```

**Typical scenarios returned:**
- `Internet exposed VM with high severity vulnerabilities has permissions to a Key Vault`
- `Internet exposed API with unauthenticated access has permissions to a storage account`
- `Internet exposed VM can authenticate to a VM which has access to a storage account`

> **Coverage**: ARG attack paths cover **cloud-only, internet-exposed** scenarios. They do NOT include device → identity → resource paths (those are in ExposureGraph). The "Device with high severity vulnerabilities..." paths visible in the Defender portal come from ExposureGraph, not ARG.

#### Query 32: Attack Path Summary by Scenario with Instance Counts

**Description**: Group pre-computed attack paths by scenario name with counts per scenario  
**Use Case**: Quick overview of which attack path types exist and their prevalence  
**Execution**: Azure CLI (not Advanced Hunting)

<!-- cd-metadata
cd_ready: false
adaptation_notes: "Azure Resource Graph CLI query (az graph query) — not KQL for Defender XDR Advanced Hunting. Runs against ARM, not applicable for CD."
-->
```bash
az graph query -q "
  securityresources
  | where type == 'microsoft.security/attackpaths'
  | extend DisplayName = tostring(properties.displayName)
  | summarize Count = count() by DisplayName
  | order by Count desc
" --first 100
```

**Full remediation detail** for a specific path (includes `graphComponent` with entities, connections, and insights):

```bash
az graph query -q "
  securityresources
  | where type == 'microsoft.security/attackpaths'
  | where properties.displayName has 'Key Vault'
  | take 1
" --first 1 -o json
```

The `graphComponent` field contains the full attack chain: source entity → intermediate hops → target, with remediation recommendations for each step.
