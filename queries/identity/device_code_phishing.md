## Overview

Queries derived from the Microsoft Security blog: [Inside an AI-enabled device code phishing campaign (April 2026)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2026/04/06/ai-enabled-device-code-phishing-campaign-april-2026/).

This campaign represents a significant escalation from the [Storm-2372 device code phishing campaign (Feb 2025)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2025/02/13/storm-2372-conducts-device-code-phishing-campaign/), driven by the **EvilToken** Phishing-as-a-Service (PhaaS) toolkit with:

- **Dynamic device code generation** — codes generated at click time (not pre-embedded in email), defeating the 15-minute expiry window
- **AI-generated hyper-personalized lures** — role-aligned themes (RFPs, invoices, manufacturing workflows)
- **Automated backend infrastructure** — Railway.com, Vercel, Cloudflare Workers, AWS Lambda nodes for short-lived polling
- **Browser-in-the-browser** — simulated browser windows hosting the auth handoff
- **Post-compromise automation** — Graph API reconnaissance, persona identification, targeted financial exfiltration

### Attack Chain Phases

| Phase | Activity | MITRE Technique |
|-------|----------|-----------------|
| 1. **Recon** | GetCredentialType endpoint probing (10-15d before phish) | T1589.002 |
| 2. **Initial Access** | Phishing emails with URLs/PDFs/HTML → redirect chain through serverless platforms | T1566.002 |
| 3. **Dynamic Code Gen** | Backend generates live device code at click time via `/api/device/start/` | T1528 |
| 4. **Exploitation** | Clipboard hijack + microsoft.com/devicelogin → user pastes code + MFA | T1550.001 |
| 5. **Validation** | Polling `/state` endpoint every 3-5s for token capture | T1528 |
| 6. **Persistence** | Device registration (PRT), malicious inbox rules, email exfiltration | T1098.005, T1114.002, T1114.003 |

### IOC IP Ranges

| IP Range | Infrastructure | Description |
|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `160.220.232.0/24` | Railway.com | Threat actor sign-in infrastructure |
| `160.220.234.0/24` | Railway.com | Threat actor sign-in infrastructure |
| `89.150.45.0/24` | HZ Hosting | Threat actor sign-in infrastructure |
| `185.81.113.0/24` | HZ Hosting | Threat actor sign-in infrastructure |
| `8.228.105.0/24` | — | Threat actor sign-in infrastructure |

### IOC Domains (Redirect Infrastructure)

| Domain Pattern | Type | Purpose |
|---------------|------|---------|
| `*.vercel.app` | Serverless hosting | Redirect chain / phishing page hosting |
| `*.workers.dev` | Cloudflare Workers | Redirect chain |
| `*.railway.app` | Railway.com PaaS | Backend polling / token capture |
| `graph-microsoft[.]com` | Brand impersonation | Phishing domain |
| `portal-azure[.]com` | Brand impersonation | Phishing domain |
| `office365-login[.]com` | Brand impersonation | Phishing domain |
| `office-verify[.]net` (with randomized subdomains) | Brand impersonation | Phishing domain |

### Table Compatibility Notes

> **`EntraIdSignInEvents`** is the current table name (replaces deprecated `AADSignInEventsBeta` since Dec 9, 2025). **Case-sensitive**: use exactly `EntraIdSignInEvents` (capital `I` in `SignIn`). The table includes the `RiskLevelDuringSignIn` column that `AADSignInEventsBeta` lacked. Schema verified in workspace 2026-04-06.
>
> For **Data Lake** / **Sentinel** queries (90d lookback), use `SigninLogs` + `AADNonInteractiveUserSignInLogs` as equivalents.

## Phase 1-4 Detection: Device Code Authentication

### Query 1: ErrorCode 50199 Followed by Success (Device Code Auth Pause)

**Purpose:** Detects the telltale device code phishing pattern — ErrorCode 50199 (user interaction required / device code input pause) followed by a successful auth (ErrorCode 0) within the same session. This is the signature of a user pasting a device code at `microsoft.com/devicelogin`.  
**Severity:** Medium  
**MITRE:** T1528, T1550.001

> **Validation (2026-04-06):** 49 results in 30d via Advanced Hunting — confirmed active device code auth in the environment.

| where ErrorCodes has_all (0, 50199)
| project AccountUpn, CorrelationId, SessionId, Timestamp, IPs, Apps
| order by Timestamp desc
```

### Query 2: Device Code Flow via EndpointCall (Cmsi:cmsi Indicator)

**Purpose:** Directly identifies device code authentication flow events using the `EndpointCall` field containing `Cmsi:cmsi` — the Entra ID server-side marker for the CMSI (Client Message Security Identifier) flow used in device code auth. This is more reliable than ErrorCode-based detection because it catches all device code flows regardless of outcome.  
**Severity:** Medium  
**MITRE:** T1528, T1550.001

> **Validation (2026-04-06):** 25 unique users with device code flow activity in 30d. Top user: 24 successful attempts.

    RiskLevelDuringSignIn, RiskState, DeviceName, DeviceTrustType,
    IsManaged, IsCompliant, SessionId, UserAgent, Browser
| order by Timestamp desc
```

### Query 3: Device Code Auth Summary per User (Hunting)

**Purpose:** Summary view of all device code authentication activity per user for triage — shows attempt volume, success/fail ratio, geographic spread, and apps accessed. Useful for identifying both legitimate device code usage (conference rooms, IoT) and suspicious activity.  
**Severity:** Informational  
**MITRE:** T1528

<!-- cd-metadata

    LastSeen = max(Timestamp)
    by AccountUpn
| extend SuccessRate = round(100.0 * SuccessCount / AttemptCount, 1)
| order by AttemptCount desc
```

---

## Phase 1: IOC-Based Detection

### Query 4: Sign-Ins from EvilToken/Campaign IOC IP Ranges

**Purpose:** Detects sign-ins from the specific IP ranges identified as threat actor infrastructure in the April 2026 blog (Railway.com PaaS, HZ Hosting). These IPs were observed serving device code polling and token capture backends.  
**Severity:** High  
**MITRE:** T1566.002, T1528

> **Validation (2026-04-06):** 0 results in 30d (AH) and 90d (Data Lake) — ✅ No sign-ins from campaign IOC IPs detected. IOCs are environment-clean.

<!-- cd-metadata

// Platform: Defender XDR Advanced Hunting
// Source: Microsoft Security Blog (April 2026)
// ⚠️ Update IOC list as new indicators are published
EntraIdSignInEvents
| where Timestamp > ago(30d)
| where IPAddress has_any (
    "160.220.232.", "160.220.234.",  // Railway.com
    "89.150.45.", "185.81.113.",      // HZ Hosting
    "8.228.105."                      // Additional campaign infra
)
| project
    Timestamp, AccountUpn, IPAddress, Country, City, ErrorCode,
    Application, RiskLevelDuringSignIn, RiskState, SessionId,
    DeviceName, UserAgent
| order by Timestamp desc
```

### Query 4b: IOC IP Ranges — Data Lake 90-Day Lookback

**Purpose:** Extended lookback for IOC IPs using Sentinel Data Lake (SigninLogs). Use when Advanced Hunting's 30-day window isn't sufficient.  
**Severity:** High  
**MITRE:** T1566.002, T1528

<!-- cd-metadata
cd_ready: false
adaptation_notes: "Sentinel Data Lake query for 90d lookback. Not suitable for CD (CD uses Advanced Hunting)."
-->
```kql
// IOC IP ranges — 90-day lookback via Sentinel Data Lake
// Platform: Microsoft Sentinel (Data Lake)
let IOC_IPs = dynamic(["160.220.232.", "160.220.234.", "89.150.45.", "185.81.113.", "8.228.105."]);

    RiskLevelDuringSignIn, RiskState,
    tostring(parse_json(DeviceDetail).operatingSystem),
    UserAgent
| order by TimeGenerated desc
```

---

## Phase 2: Phishing Redirect Infrastructure Detection

### Query 5: URL Clicks to Serverless Redirect Infrastructure

**Purpose:** Detects user clicks on URLs hosted on the serverless platforms and brand-impersonating domains used in this campaign's redirect chain (Vercel, Cloudflare Workers, Railway.com, fake Microsoft/Azure domains). These platforms are used to host the intermediate redirect logic that delivers victims to the device code phishing page.  
**Severity:** Medium  
**MITRE:** T1566.002

> **Validation (2026-04-06):** 20 results in 30d — clicks to `*.vercel.app` domains detected (various clone/impersonation sites).

<!-- cd-metadata
cd_ready: true
schedule: "1H"
category: "InitialAccess"
title: "URL click to suspicious redirect infrastructure by {{AccountUpn}}"
impactedAssets:
  - type: user
    identifier: accountUpn
adaptation_notes: "Single-table UrlClickEvents filter. Broad serverless domain filter may have FP from legitimate dev apps — tune with exclusion list per org."
-->
```kql
// Detect clicks to phishing redirect infrastructure
// Platform: Defender XDR Advanced Hunting
// Source: Microsoft Security Blog (April 2026)
UrlClickEvents
| where Timestamp > ago(30d)
| where Url has_any (
        ".vercel.app", ".workers.dev", ".railway.app",          // Serverless hosting
        "graph-microsoft.", "portal-azure.", "office365-login.", // Brand impersonation
        "office-verify."                                        // Randomized subdomain pattern
    )
    or UrlChain has_any (
        ".vercel.app", ".workers.dev", ".railway.app",
        "graph-microsoft.", "portal-azure.", "office365-login.",
        "office-verify."
    )
| project
    Timestamp, AccountUpn, Url, UrlChain, ActionType,
    ThreatTypes, DetectionMethods, IPAddress,
    IsClickedThrough, Workload
| order by Timestamp desc
```

### Query 6: URL Click Correlated with Risky Sign-In (Full Kill Chain)

**Purpose:** Connects the dots across the full attack chain — a user clicks a URL (phishing link), then within minutes performs a successful risky sign-in (device code auth from threat actor infrastructure). This is the highest-confidence detection for an active device code phishing compromise.  
**Severity:** High  
**MITRE:** T1566.002, T1528, T1550.001

> **Validation (2026-04-06):** 50+ results in 30d — URL-click-to-risky-sign-in correlations found (requires investigation to distinguish legitimate risky sign-ins from actual phishing).

<!-- cd-metadata
cd_ready: true

-->
```kql
// Kill chain: URL click → risky sign-in within minutes
// Platform: Defender XDR Advanced Hunting
// Source: Microsoft Security Blog (April 2026) — adapted for EntraIdSignInEvents
let suspiciousUserClicks = materialize(UrlClickEvents
    | where Timestamp > ago(30d)
    | extend AccountUpn = tolower(AccountUpn)
    | project ClickTime = Timestamp, ActionType, UrlChain, NetworkMessageId, Url, AccountUpn);
let interestedUsersUpn = suspiciousUserClicks
    | where isnotempty(AccountUpn)
    | distinct AccountUpn;
EntraIdSignInEvents
| where Timestamp > ago(30d)
| where ErrorCode == 0
| where AccountUpn in~ (interestedUsersUpn)
| where RiskLevelDuringSignIn in (10, 50, 100)  // Low=10, Medium=50, High=100
| extend AccountUpn = tolower(AccountUpn)
| join kind=inner suspiciousUserClicks on AccountUpn

| project
    Timestamp, AccountUpn, RiskLevelDuringSignIn,
    SessionId, IPAddress, ClickTime, Url, ReportId
| order by Timestamp desc
```

---

## Phase 6: Post-Compromise Detection

### Query 7: Suspicious Device Registration (PRT Persistence)

**Purpose:** Detects device registration events initiated by the "Device Registration Service" account — a post-compromise technique where threat actors register a new device to generate a Primary Refresh Token (PRT) for long-term persistent access. In the campaign, this occurred within 10 minutes of token capture.  
**Severity:** High  
**MITRE:** T1098.005

> **Validation (2026-04-06):** 0 results in 30d — ✅ No suspicious device registration activity detected.

<!-- cd-metadata

title: "Suspicious device registration for {{UserPrincipalName}}"
impactedAssets:
  - type: user
    identifier: accountUpn
adaptation_notes: "Single-table CloudAppEvents with JSON parsing. Row-level output. High-signal — device registration by 'Device Registration Service' is uncommon."
-->
```kql
// Post-compromise: Suspicious device registration (PRT persistence)
// Platform: Defender XDR Advanced Hunting
// Source: Microsoft Security Blog (April 2026)
CloudAppEvents
| where Timestamp > ago(30d)
| where AccountDisplayName == "Device Registration Service"
| extend ApplicationId_ = tostring(ActivityObjects[0].ApplicationId)
| extend ServiceName_ = tostring(ActivityObjects[0].Name)
| extend DeviceName = tostring(parse_json(tostring(RawEventData.ModifiedProperties))[1].NewValue)
| extend DeviceId = tostring(parse_json(tostring(parse_json(tostring(RawEventData.ModifiedProperties))[6].NewValue))[0])
| extend DeviceObjectId_ = tostring(parse_json(tostring(RawEventData.ModifiedProperties))[0].NewValue)
| extend UserPrincipalName = tostring(RawEventData.ObjectId)
| project
    Timestamp, ServiceName_, DeviceName, DeviceId,
    DeviceObjectId_, UserPrincipalName, IPAddress, City, CountryCode
| order by Timestamp desc
```

### Query 8: Malicious Inbox Rules with Special-Character Names

**Purpose:** Detects inbox rules created via Exchange Online where the rule name consists entirely of special characters (e.g., `..`, `//`, `!!`). This is a campaign-specific post-compromise IOC — threat actors use special-character-only rule names to hide rules in the UI and avoid keyword-based detection. These rules typically forward, redirect, or delete inbound email.  
**Severity:** High  
**MITRE:** T1114.003, T1564.008

> **Validation (2026-04-06):** 0 results in 30d — ✅ No special-character inbox rules detected.

<!-- cd-metadata

-->
```kql

| where isnotempty(IPAddress)
| mv-expand ActivityObjects
| extend name = tostring(parse_json(ActivityObjects).Name)
| extend value = tostring(parse_json(ActivityObjects).Value)
| where name == "Name"

| project
    Timestamp, AccountDisplayName, ActionType, RuleName,
    IPAddress, CountryCode, City
| order by Timestamp desc
```

### Query 9: All Inbox Rule Modifications with Suspicious Properties (Broader Hunt)

**Purpose:** Broader detection of inbox rule creation/modification with extraction of forwarding, redirect, and delete-message properties. Catches both the special-character campaign IOC and other suspicious inbox rule patterns (forwarding to external addresses, auto-delete rules). Use this for comprehensive post-compromise triage.  
**Severity:** Medium  
**MITRE:** T1114.003, T1020

> **Validation (2026-04-06):** 4 results in 30d — legitimate transport rules found (SAP compromise rule + email restriction rules).

)
| summarize
    Properties = make_bag(pack(name, value))
    by Timestamp, AccountDisplayName, ActionType, IPAddress, CountryCode
| order by Timestamp desc
```

### Query 10: Email Exfiltration — MailItemsAccessed from Uncommon ISP

**Purpose:** Detects email access (MailItemsAccessed via Exchange Online) where the ISP is uncommon for the user — a strong indicator of token replay from threat actor infrastructure. The campaign used stolen tokens to access email from infrastructure IPs that the user had never previously used.  
**Severity:** High  
**MITRE:** T1114.002

> **Validation (2026-04-06):** 0 results in 30d — ✅ No uncommon-ISP mail access detected.

## Cross-Phase: Correlated Hunting

### Query 11: Anomalous Graph API Mail Access Volume (Nobelium-Pattern Exfiltration)

**Purpose:** Identifies users with unusually high MailItemsAccessed volume or multi-country email access via Exchange Online — patterns consistent with automated email exfiltration using stolen tokens (similar to Nobelium/Storm-0558 techniques, now used in device code phishing post-compromise).  
**Severity:** Medium  
**MITRE:** T1114.002, T1071.001

> **Validation (2026-04-06):** 4 results in 30d — users with >100 mail access events detected. Requires baseline comparison for anomaly confirmation.

    FirstSeen = min(Timestamp),
    LastSeen = max(Timestamp)
    by AccountDisplayName
| where TotalAccess > 100 or DistinctCountries > 2
| order by TotalAccess desc
```

### Query 12: Device Code Auth → Post-Compromise Activity Chain

**Purpose:** Correlates users who authenticated via device code flow with subsequent suspicious CloudAppEvents activity (mail access, send, search). This connects the initial access vector to post-compromise activity for full kill-chain visibility.  
**Severity:** High  
**MITRE:** T1528, T1114.002
